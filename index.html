    <p style="text-align: justify">
      This is our Chronergy escapement, introduced in 2015. This mechanism
      transmits energy with unrelenting precision to regulate the heartbeat of
      the watch. Its wheel and anchor have been redesigned to optimize the
      system’s efficiency. The overarching principle is simple: an anchor with
      two pallets frees the rotation of a dented wheel, in a minutely timed
      dance. “Tick”, the first pallet stops the wheel. “Tock”, it releases it
      and leaves the second pallet to halt its rotation. And so on. This happens
      eight times per second without ever skipping a single beat. That makes
      28,800 rounds per hour, amounting to 14,400 “ticks” and as many “tocks”. A
      metronomic and perpetual cadence that sets every cog and wheel in motion.
      Which, in turn, brings the watch to life. Yet further proof that, when it
      comes to mastering time, nothing escapes us.

    <h2 style="color: rgb(168, 168, 168);">Shocking!</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Paraflex Shocking! This is the Paraflex, our shock absorber introduced in
      2005. It is an absolutely crucial element in the protection of our
      horological movements. One which we designed and manufactured solely
      ourselves. Its specific purpose is to neutralize any and all effects
      brought about by the knocks and bumps of everyday life. One may wonder how
      such a minuscule shield, no bigger than a grain of rice, could achieve
      such a feat? It is through the interaction of two separate properties
      which, in a never-ending dance, offset the consequences of all shocks at
      all times. The Paraflex moves one way, then the other, all within a
      fraction of a second. On the one hand, it bends at each impact to disperse
      the energy, then returns to its original shape. On the other, it displaces
      itself so as to preserve the functionality of the balance wheel and
      escapement anchor. Thus engaging the guarantee of the chronometric
      performance of the calibre in all circumstances. It is through this unique
      ballet of deformation and displacement that the Paraflex preserves the
      watch’s movement with its own.

    <h2 style="color: rgb(168, 168, 168);">Always on</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Always on This is the Perpetual rotor. Rolex’s automatic winding
      mechanism. It enables the watch to be constantly wound by the wrist’s
      movement. Invented in our workshops, then patented, it was introduced in
      1931. We have ceaselessly improved this groundbreaking innovation which,
      since then, has tipped the world of watchmaking off its old axis. In a
      constant state of unstable equilibrium, the half-moon oscillating weight
      is beholden to Earth’s gravity and cannot escape it. Therefore, it rotates
      with the wearer’s every gesture, and sways in one direction or the other.
      The energy generated by these oscillations is transferred to the
      mainspring, which is continually wound, through a clever system comprised
      of inverters and a gear train. Thus stored, the energy is released
      simultaneously to activate the horological movement, ultimately moving the
      hands of the watch. Regularly. Precisely. For though we all seek balance,
      it is imbalance that drives us to move, perpetually.

    <h2 style="color: rgb(168, 168, 168);">Why complicate matters</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      matters? 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31: the annual
      sequence of months is more complicated than it appears. In horological
      terms, its inconsistency must be addressed when designing an annual
      calendar such as our Saros, first introduced in 2012 with the Sky-Dweller.
      Like all annual calendars, it autonomously differentiates months with 30
      and 31 days and only requires to be set once every year, when February
      turns to March. Developing such a complication usually requires
      beautifully intricate mechanisms, with countless levers, cams and springs.
      But it is a different type of beauty that has always held our favour: that
      of simplicity. No matter how difficult it may be to reach. Here, it took
      us many years of development to finally make our annual calendar, using
      only four gear wheels and two gear ratios. Nothing more. Its conception is
      so efficient, the movement’s performance and durability are in no way
      affected. To the contrary, it allows for the energy dispensed by the
      feature to be perfectly managed. Perhaps that is why it is considered a
      horological prowess. The Saros is a most ingenious watchmaking
      complication.
