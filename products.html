          <h1>Dates and days</h1>
          The Day-Date was originally designed to be a precious instrument for
          everyday use. Thanks to a watchmaking prowess that was unprecedented
          at the time, it offered a solution to those requiring complete mastery
          of their personal calendar: the Day-Date was the first self-winding,
          waterproof chronometer wristwatch to display, in addition to the date,
          the day of the week spelt out in full, in two separate windows. Both
          change simultaneously at midnight. This revolutionary switch continues
          to fascinate, nearly seven decades later.

        <h1>COSMOGRAPH DAYTONA</h1>
        The Cosmograph Daytona is emblematic of Rolex’s expertise and stands out
        by virtue of its chronometric precision as well as its unfailing
        reliability. For years, Rolex engineers worked on the design and
        development of calibre 4130, which was optimized to become calibre 4131
        in 2023. An adaptation of calibre 4131, calibre 4132, was also launched
        the same year. Since its creation, the calibre, which is comprised of a
        minimal number of parts, has established itself as one of the most
        efficient and robust in the world.

          The Chromalight display is an innovation that improves visibility in
          dark environments, an essential feature for divers. An innovative
          luminescent material emitting a blue glow is applied to the hands,
          hour markers and the capsule on the bezel. Hour markers in simple
          shapes – triangle, circle, rectangle – and broad hour and minute hands
          enable instant and reliable reading to prevent any risk of confusion
          underwater.
