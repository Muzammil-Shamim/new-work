    <h2 style="color: rgb(168, 168, 168);">Our Story</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      WatchShop’s history dates right back to 1991, when Sham Naib founded the
      jewellery retailer SDK Jewellers in the town which is still WatchShop’s
      home, Reading in Berkshire. When Sham’s son, Kishore Naib, joined the
      business in 2007, he established the website Watchshop.co.uk. Our official
      founding! The Naib family proudly sold the business in 2014, and we have
      since grown into the biggest independent watch retailer in the UK. <br /><br>A
      watch is an important part of any outfit. It defines your style, tells a
      story, and sets you apart from the world. But modern-day fashion is
      getting out of reach of the common man. Lack of local resellers,
      unreasonable prices, and unfaithful reproduction of watches had pushed
      desirable timepieces out of the grasp of most people. Royal Wrist is the
      answer to all these woes, providing original and authentic watches on a
      budget.
